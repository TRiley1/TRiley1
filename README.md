**👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!**

Hello! I'm Thomas Riley, a junior software engineer. I've experience in Python, Java, JavaScript and have recently tried TypeScript.

**🛠️ Currently Working On**

I'm currently working on a social media application called Grumble. Here users can vent their frustrations and be judged by the grumble community on whether their moan is valid or not.

**🛠️ Recently Completed**

A mobile game called scuba squirell which was built using react native and implemented the physics engine matter.js. This game follows the adventures of a squirell in its endless pursuit of acorns as it braves the harsh conditions of the ocean and the sealife within. 

**🎮 Gaming and Sports**

When I'm not coding, I love playing video games and watching sports. I play a range of games but mainly: Fifa, Football Manager and Call of Duty.
