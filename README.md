**👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!**

Hello! I'm Thomas RIley, a junior software engineer venturing into the tech world. I've explored Python, Java, JavaScript and recently dipped into TypeScript, shaping my skills across diverse languages.

**🚀 Code and Creativity**

My journey involves translating creativity into code, with projects spanning Python's flexibility, Java's solidity, JavaScript's interactivity, and TypeScript's type safety.

**🎮 Gaming and 🎬 Film**

When not coding, I'm a passionate gamer, enjoying FIFA, Call of Duty, and Rocket League. Additionally, I'm a supporter of Manchester United and a Cinophile, with my favourite film, "Dodgeball," being a reminder that resilience conquers challenges.

**📚 Let's Connect**

I'm excited to connect with fellow developers, gamers, sport lovers, and anyone intrigued by technology, entertainment, and sports. Explore my projects, chat about coding, game strategies, or the latest match – let's embrace the tech world together.
