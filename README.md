**👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!**

Hello! I'm Thomas Riley, a junior software engineer venturing into the tech world. I've explored Python, Java, JavaScript and recently dipped into TypeScript.

**🛠️ Currently Working On**

I'm currently working on a social media application called Grumble. Here users can vent their frustrations and be judged by the grumble community on whether their moan is valid or not.

**🎮 Gaming and 🎬 Film**

When not coding, I'm a passionate gamer, enjoying FIFA, Call of Duty, and Rocket League. Additionally, I'm a supporter of Manchester United and a film buff, with my favourite film, "Dodgeball," being a reminder that resilience conquers challenges and a wrench.
